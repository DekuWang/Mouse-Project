# This is my final project for CNIT 176, which allows users to control the mouse by using a camera.

## How to use? 
There are two ways to run the program: you can change the IP address to localhost so you can run both server and client in one device, or you can change the ip address in the client program to your Pi Ip address so you can connect your PC to Pi via Socket. 

Or if you don't want to RPi, you can run both RPIProgram.py and Client.py on one device. When run the Client.py, type in localhost as the ip address.
